# Abstract

Clients of Gas stations work together to share prices of every gas station. Someone can look for a gas station in his area and choose one by the price offered. The prices are provided by accounted users. To find out if the prices are truthful there is a like/dislike method that can be used by every user (also not accouted users). The location of the gas station is provided by GoogleMaps service.

# Stories and personas

John is an employee in a commercial company. Every day he does the same way to get to work with his car. Twice a week, on monday and on thursday he stops to get gas in the same gas station, and every time he takes note of the price for suggesting that gas station to his collegues.
His collegues decide to stop to the gas station suggedìsted by John, only if the price is convenient, but they don’ know if it is higher or lower than their gas station of trust. 
So John decides to ask a friend of his to develop an app where someone can take note of the price of gas of a certian gas station, and share it with everyone that is located near that gas station. With this app he can suggest more efficiently a gas station to his collegues.

Mary is reporter, and has to travel a lot with her car. All the costs for the travels are not included in her salary, so she wants always to save money on gas, hotels and highway taxes. For this, every time she has to get gas, she looks for the cheaper price and since she find out the EZGas app she is very happy, because she doesn’t have to struggle a lot to find the cheaper gas station during her travels.
