# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that shares prices of gas stations. Users can just use the service to check prices, but they can also interact with it adding untracked gas stations or updateing current prices if they are obsolete. An administrator must approve every add/update performed by a user.

The user can filter the list of stations based on price, distance, or based on the last update date of each station. To find out if the prices are truthful there is a review system that can be used by users.

The administrator is in charge of managing the service (User, accounts, and Stations), access to the Gas station data. The administrator also checks reports of users and approve/disapprove modifications. In this version, the administrator just checks if data inserted by a user is reliable (i.e., no dumb or unlikely data). If so, the administrator always approves the request.

The service uses an external Map Service provider.

# Stories and personas
John is an employee in a commercial company. Every day he does the same way to get to work in his car. Twice a week, on Monday and Thursday, he stops to get gas in the same gas station, and every time he takes note of the price for suggesting that gas station to his colleagues.
His colleagues decide to stop to the gas station suggested by John, only if the price is reasonable, but they don’ know if it is higher or lower than their gas station of trust. 
So John decides to use EZGas service to update prices of a specific gas station and share them with everyone. With this app, he can suggest more efficiently a gas station to his colleagues.

Jimmy is a delivery man who has always been very conscious about gas prices. To support his route's decisions and maximize his efficiency both money and time -wise he frequently takes a peek at the EZGAS app, particularely useful in case a new gas pump shows up. Moreover he's happy to do his part by checking and updating any gas price he can find, thus helping fellow drivers.

Mary is reporter, and has to travel a lot with her car. All the costs for the travels are not included in her salary, so she wants always to save money on gas, hotels and highway taxes. For this, every time she has to get gas, she looks for the cheaper price and since she find out the EZGas app she is very happy, because she doesn’t have to struggle a lot to find the cheaper gas station during her travels.

Bob uses EZGas to find gas stations. In a certain moment, he realize that a station reported in the app doesn't exist anymore and he would like to avoid that other people can live the same inconvenient. So, he send a report to an administrator signal that the specified station no longer exist, hoping that the report can be managed as soon as possible.
