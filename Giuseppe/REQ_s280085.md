# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service which shares prices of GasStations. Users can just use the service to check prices, but they can also interact adding untracked Stations or updated existing prices if they are obsolete. Every add/update performed by a user must be approved by an administrator.

The user can filter the list of stations based on price, distance, or based on the last update date of each station. Up to date stations are marked with a green box, whereas stations updated more than 1 days ago are marked with a yellow box, and the ones updated more then 5 days ago are marken with a red box.

The administrator is in charge of manage the service (User, accounts and Stations), accessing to the Gas stations data. Administrator also checks reports of users and approve/disapprove modifications. In this version, the administrator just check if data inserted by a user is reliable (i.e. no dumb or unlikely data). If so, the administrator always approve the request.

The service uses an external Map Service provider.

# Stories and personas
John is an employee in a commercial company. Every day he does the same way to get to work with his car. Twice a week, on monday and on thursday he stops to get gas in the same gas station, and every time he takes note of the price for suggesting that gas station to his collegues.
His collegues decide to stop to the gas station suggested by John, only if the price is convenient, but they donâ€™ know if it is higher or lower than their gas station of trust. 
So John decides to ask a friend of his to develop an app where someone can take note of the price of gas of a certian gas station, and share it with everyone that is located near that gas station. With this app he can suggest more efficiently a gas station to his collegues.

A user wants to find the cheapest gas station near his location. He also would like to inform other users when he find wrong or obsolete price, or just a gas station which is not recorded..

A guest user just wants to find a near and cheap gas station. He his happy to see many gas station and up to date prices on EzGas service.

Another user found a Gas station that doesn't exist anymore (or it's just a fake information): he can report the situation to the administrator.
