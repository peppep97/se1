Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.

Team formation is pretty fair, plus every group can start working together right away
Working in a one team in a one project is worthfull expreinces

# Worst things
Too much uncertainty around requirements and assignments
Some problems with pre-defined spring 

# Suggestions 
Probably give a little and early introduction to extensively used frameworks as Spring
