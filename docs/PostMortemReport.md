Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things
Team formation is pretty fair, plus every group can start working together right away.

Working in a team for a project is a worthful expreinces.

The project puts the students in a context very close to the work one.

# Worst things
Too much uncertainty around requirements and assignments.

Some problems with pre-defined Spring.


# Suggestions 
Probably give a little and early introduction to extensively used frameworks as Spring.

Give more support and suggestion to the student about project delivery.
