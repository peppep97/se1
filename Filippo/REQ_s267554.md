# Stakeholders


| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
|         Users          |      Use and contribute to the application by sharing info about stations and prices      | 
|       Map Provider       |              Map Provider like OSM to geolocate users' and stations' position               |

# Stories and personas
Wendy does the same commute by car every day to go to work and always stops at the nearest gas station she can finds. Lately a colleague of hers has been very enthusiast about the price of a certain gas station; to investigate Wendy has downloaded the new EZGAS app so that once in a while she checks the real deal among the many gas pumps along her path.

Jimmy is a delivery man who has always been very conscious about gas prices. To support his route's decisions and maximize his efficiency both money and time -wise he frequently takes a peek at the EZGAS app, particularely useful in case a new gas pump shows up. Moreover he's happy to do his part by checking and updating any gas price he can find, thus helping fellow drivers.

# Use case diagram and use cases


## Use case diagram

### Use case 1, UC1 Show gas stations nearby
| Actors Involved        | User, Map Provider |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Geo-localization activated |  
|  Post condition     | Map-layer of given area loaded with gas stations on it |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User enables geo-localization, Client asks Map Provider for layer of an area, Client asks Server for gas stations in that area, Client loads reponses |
|  Variants     | Area is selected by User, is movable or geo-loc is simply not enabled |

##### Scenario 1.1 
| Scenario 1.1 | |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Geo-localization activated |
|  Post condition     | Map-layer of given area loaded with gas stations on it |
| Step#        | Description  |
|  1     | Client asks Map Provider for layer of area User is at |  
|  2     | Client asks Server for gas stations of area User is at |
|  3     | Client loads Map layer |
|  4     | Client populates area with gas stations |

##### Scenario 1.2
| Scenario 1.2 | |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | |
|  Post condition     | Map-layer of given area loaded with gas stations on it |
| Step#        | Description  |
|  1     | Client asks Map Provider for layer of selected area |  
|  2     | Client asks Server for gas stations of selected area |
|  3     | Client loads Map layer |
|  4     | Client populates area with gas stations |

# Glossary

\<use UML class diagram to define important concepts in the domain of the system, and their relationships> 

\<concepts are used consistently all over the document, ex in use cases, requirements etc>

# System Design
\<describe here system design>

\<must be consistent with Context diagram>
