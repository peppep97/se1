# Stakeholders


| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
|         Users          |      Use and contribute to the application by sharing info about stations and prices      | 
|       Map System       |              Map system like OSM to geolocate users' and stations' position               |

# Stories and personas
Wendy does the same commute by car every day to go to work and always stops at the nearest gas station she can finds. Lately a colleague of hers has been very enthusiast about the price of a certain gas station; to investigate Wendy has downloaded the new EZGAS app so that once in a while she checks the real deal among the many gas pumps along her path.

Jimmy is a delivery man who has always been very conscious about gas prices. To support his route's decisions and maximize his efficiency both money and time -wise he frequently takes a peek at the EZGAS app, particularely useful in case a new gas pump shows up. Moreover he's happy to do his part by checking and updating any gas price he can find, thus helping fellow drivers.

# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements


| ID        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| FR1  |                         Update price/s of a gas station                         |
| FR2  |                            Add a new gas station                                |
| FR3  |                           Log in/out the service                                |
| FR8  |                  Show every gas station in a given area                         |
| FR9  |                            Register a new user account                          |
| FR10 |              Filter/sort stations by fuel, price and distance                   |
| FR11 |                           Report false informations                             |

## Non Functional Requirements

\<Describe constraints on functional requirements>

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, ..)           | Description  | Refers to |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
|  NFR1     |   |  | |
|  NFR2     | |  | |

# Use case diagram and use cases


## Use case diagram
\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>


\<next describe here each use case in the UCD>
### Use case 1, UC1
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |  
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after UC is finished> |
|  Nominal Scenario     | \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC> |
|  Variants     | \<other executions, ex in case of errors> |

##### Scenario 1.1 

\<describe here scenarios instances of UC1>

\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>

\<a scenario is a more formal description of a story>

\<only relevant scenarios should be described>

| Scenario 1.1 | |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the scenario can start> |
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after scenario is finished> |
| Step#        | Description  |
|  1     |  |  
|  2     |  |
|  ...     |  |

##### Scenario 1.2

### Use case 2, UC2
..

### Use case
..



# Glossary

\<use UML class diagram to define important concepts in the domain of the system, and their relationships> 

\<concepts are used consistently all over the document, ex in use cases, requirements etc>

# System Design
\<describe here system design>

\<must be consistent with Context diagram>

# Deployment Diagram 

\<describe here deployment diagram >
