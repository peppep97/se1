# Stories and personas
Wendy does the same commute by car every day to go to work and always stops at the nearest gas station she can finds. Lately a colleague of hers has been very enthusiast about the price of a certain gas station; to investigate Wendy has downloaded the new EZGAS app so that once in a while she checks the real deal among the many gas pumps along her path.

Jimmy is a delivery man who has always been very conscious about gas prices. To support his route's decisions and maximize his efficiency both money and time -wise he frequently takes a peek at the EZGAS app, particularely useful in case a new gas pump shows up. Moreover he's happy to do his part by checking and updating any gas price he can find, thus helping fellow drivers.
